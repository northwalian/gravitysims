These are my crappy n-body simulations.

2bodyupdate1.0 reproduces the Sun-Jupiter system with an animated plot.
3bodysim1.0 and 3bodyupdate1.0 are 3-body simulations. Sim produces a static figure, whereas update has an animated plot showing time-evolution with fixed axes.

Now with 3D sims! 3d3bodysim1.3 gives a static figure (you don't want to see v1.0, v1.1, v1.2. They didn't work). 3d3bodyupdate1.2 features an animated plot that I still don't really understand how to rotate without everything going weird. Also has fixed axes.

The most up-to-date sims (3bodyupdate1.2 and 3d3bodyupdate1.3) now have code that automatically give you the proper axes, so there's no need to tweak them anymore.
