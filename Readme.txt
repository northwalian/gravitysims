These are my crappy n-body simulations.

2bodyupdate1.0 reproduces the Sun-Jupiter system with an animated plot.
3bodysim1.0 and 3bodyupdate1.0 are 3-body simulations. Sim produces a static figure, whereas update has an animated plot showing time-evolution with fixed axes.

The 3-body system is very chaotic, and you may need to change the fixed axes in 3bodyupdate if you want to tweak the system's initial dynamics.

I'll probably add a 3D system at some point, but it's a bit of a hassle, so no promises.
